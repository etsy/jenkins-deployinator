Jenkins Plugin: Deployinator
==============================

This is a plugin for [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org) Continuous Integration Server.  This plugin provides hooks (CLI) for associating Deployinator stacks to a Jenkins pipeline.

Installation
---------------------------

Install the `modularized-build-pipeline-view` plugin on Jenkins from:
https://github.com/elblinkin/mvn-repo/raw/master/snapshots/org/jvnet/hudson/plugins/modularized-build-pipeline-plugin/1.2-SNAPSHOT/modularized-build-pipeline-plugin-1.2-SNAPSHOT.hpi

Install Maven 2.2.1 or higher

    cd ~/jenkins-deployinator
    mvn package && mvn install
    scp target/deployinator.hpi user@jenkins.server:/opt/jenkins/.jenkins/plugins/.

The last part is to place the `hpi` file into the plugins directory.  You can also do this through the Jenkins interface if you do not have `ssh` access to the Jenkins server.
